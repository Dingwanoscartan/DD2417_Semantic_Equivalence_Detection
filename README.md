# DD2417 Semantic Equivalence Detection

This is the mini-project work of the course DD2417 Language Engineering at KTH

Determining whether two questions are asking the same thing can be challenging, as the differences might be very subtle. The choice of words can be quite varying while the semantic meaning stays the same.

we explore different ways to detect semantic equivalence using different GRU models, combined with several DL techniques. We also use a bagging ensemble way to combine our GRU-based models. In the end, we evaluate and compare all these approaches, with our best model achieving 83.1% accuracy on the test set. 

Our dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. The link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quora/question-pairs-dataset
